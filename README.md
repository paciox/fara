## Overview

**Fara-7B** is Microsoft's first **agentic small language model (SLM)** designed specifically for computer use. With only 7 billion parameters, Fara-7B is an ultra-compact Computer Use Agent (CUA) that achieves state-of-the-art performance within its size class and is competitive with larger, more resource-intensive agentic systems.

Try Fara-7B locally as follows (see [Installation](##Installation) for detailed instructions) or via Magentic-UI:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/fara.git
cd fara

# 2. Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
playwright install
```

Then in one process, host the model:
```bash
vllm serve "microsoft/Fara-7B" --port 5000 --dtype auto 
```
Then you can iterative query it with:
```bash
fara-cli --task "whats the weather in new york now"
```

To try Fara-7B inside Magentic-UI, please follow the instructions here [Magentic-UI + Fara-7B](https://github.com/microsoft/magentic-ui/blob/main/README.md#fara-7b). You will need to serve the model as before, but instead of fara-cli you can use Magentic-UI which has a nice UI (see video demos below).


Notes:
- If you're using Windows, we highly recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- You might need to do `--tensor-parallel-size 2` with vllm command if you run out of memory

### What Makes Fara-7B Unique

Unlike traditional chat models that generate text-based responses, Fara-7B leverages computer interfaces—mouse and keyboard—to perform multi-step tasks on behalf of users. The model:

- **Operates visually** by perceiving webpages and taking actions like scrolling, typing, and clicking on directly predicted coordinates without accessibility trees or separate parsing models
- **Enables on-device deployment** due to its compact 7B parameter size, resulting in reduced latency and improved privacy as user data remains local
- **Completes tasks efficiently**, averaging only ~16 steps per task compared to ~41 for comparable models

Fara-7B is trained using a novel synthetic data generation pipeline built on the [Magentic-One](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/) multi-agent framework, with 145K trajectories covering diverse websites, task types, and difficulty levels. The model is based on [Qwen2.5-VL-7B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13923) and trained with supervised fine-tuning.

### Key Capabilities

Fara-7B can automate everyday web tasks including:
- Searching for information and summarizing results
- Filling out forms and managing accounts
- Booking travel, movie tickets, and restaurant reservations
- Shopping and comparing prices across retailers
- Finding job postings and real estate listings

### Performance Highlights

Fara-7B achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple web agent benchmarks, outperforming both comparable-sized models and larger systems:

*Table: Breakdown of WebTailBench results across all 11 segments. Success rates (%) are averaged over 3 independent runs. Fara-7B achieves the highest performance among computer-use models across all task categories.*

**Coming Soon:**
- Task Verification pipeline for LLM-as-a-judge evaluation
- Official human annotations of WebTailBench (in partnership with BrowserBase)

### Evaluation Infrastructure

Our evaluation setup leverages:

1. **Playwright** - A cross-browser automation framework that replicates browser environments
2. **Abstract Web Agent Interface** - Allows integration of any model from any source into the evaluation environment
3. **Fara-Agent Class** - Reference implementation for running the Fara model

> **Note:** Fara-7B is an experimental release designed to invite hands-on exploration and feedback from the community. We recommend running it in a sandboxed environment, monitoring its execution, and avoiding sensitive data or high-risk domains.

## Installation

Install the package using either UV or pip:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

or

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Then install Playwright browsers:

```bash
playwright install
```

---

## Hosting the Model

**Recommended:** The easiest way to get started is using Azure Foundry hosting, which requires no GPU hardware or model downloads. Alternatively, you can self-host with VLLM if you have GPU resources available.

### Azure Foundry Hosting (Recommended)

Deploy Fara-7B on [Azure Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Fara-7B/version/2/registry/azureml-msr) without needing to download weights or manage GPU infrastructure.

**Setup:**

1. Deploy the Fara-7B model on Azure Foundry and obtain your endpoint URL and API key
2. Add your endpoint details to the existing `endpoint_configs/` directory (example configs are already provided):

```bash
# Edit one of the existing config files or create a new one
# endpoint_configs/fara-7b-hosting-ansrz.json (example format):
{
    "model": "Fara-7B",
    "base_url": "https://your-endpoint.inference.ml.azure.com/",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

3. Run the Fara agent:

```bash
fara-cli --task "how many pages does wikipedia have" --start_page "https://www.bing.com"
```

That's it! No GPU or model downloads required.

### Self-hosting with VLLM

If you have access to GPU resources, you can self-host Fara-7B using VLLM. This requires a GPU machine with sufficient VRAM.

All that is required is to run the following command to start the VLLM server:

```bash
vllm serve "microsoft/Fara-7B" --port 5000 --dtype auto 
```

### Testing the Fara Agent

Run the test script to see Fara in action:

```bash
fara-cli --task "how many pages does wikipedia have" --start_page "https://www.bing.com" --endpoint_config endpoint_configs/azure_foundry_config.json [--headful] [--downloads_folder "/path/to/downloads"] [--save_screenshots] [--max_rounds 100] [--browserbase]
```

In self-hosting scenario the `endpoint_config` points to `endpoint_configs/vllm_config.json` from the VLLM server above.

If you set `--browserbase`, export environment variables for the API key and project ID.

#### Expected Output

# Reproducibility

We provide a framework in `webeval/` to reproduce our results on WebVoyager and OnlineMind2Web. 
Agentic evaluations on live websites present unique challenges due to day-to-day changes. We implement several measures to ensure reliable and comparable evaluations:

**BrowserBase Integration**
We employ BrowserBase to manage browser session hosting, enabling reliable browser instance management.

**Time-sensitive Task Updates**
Tasks in benchmarks like WebVoyager can become stale or impossible. We:
- Removed ~48 impossible tasks from the original WebVoyager benchmark
- Updated ~50 tasks with future dates to keep them achievable
- Example: *"Search for a hotel in Bali from Jan 1 to Jan 4, 2024"* → *"Search for a hotel in Bali from Jan 1 to Jan 4, 2026"*
- Our updated WebVoyager benchmark is available at `webeval/data/webvoyager/WebVoyager_data_08312025.jsonl`

**Environment Error Handling**
Browser errors (connection drops, page timeouts) are handled robustly:
- Trajectories are retried up to 5 times when environment errors occur
- Complete yet incorrect trajectories are never retried
- Each retry starts with a fresh browser session, with no retained state

**Step Budget**
Each trajectory is capped at a maximum of 100 actions across all online benchmarks. Trajectories exceeding this budget without choosing to stop are considered incorrect.

## WebEval Package Installation

```bash
conda create --name fara_webeval python=3.12
conda activate fara_webeval

# Install fara package
pip install -e .

# Install autogen submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd autogen/python/packages
pip install -e autogen-core
pip install -e autogen-ext

# Install webeval
cd webeval
pip install -e .

# Install playwright
playwright install
```

## Running Evaluations

Navigate to the scripts directory:

```bash
cd webeval/scripts
```

Make sure you set a valid OpenAI GPT-4o endpoint in `endpoint_configs_gpt4o/dev` in order to run the WebVoyager LLM-as-a-judge! 

**Option 1: Self-hosted VLLM**

```bash
python webvoyager.py --model_url /path/where/you/want/to/download/model/ --model_port 5000 --eval_oai_config ../endpoint_configs_gpt4o/dev/ --out_url /path/to/save/eval/files --device_id 0,1 --processes 1 --run_id 1 --max_rounds 100
```

**Option 2: Azure Foundry Deployment**

Deploy [Fara-7B on Foundry endpoint(s)](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Fara-7B/version/2/registry/azureml-msr), then place endpoint URLs and keys in JSONs under `endpoint_configs/`:

```bash
python webvoyager.py --model_endpoint ../../endpoint_configs/ --eval_oai_config ../endpoint_configs_gpt4o/dev/ --out_url /path/to/save/eval/files --processes 1 --run_id 1_endpoint --max_rounds 100
```

### Notes


- We use the same LLM-as-a-judge prompts and model (GPT-4o) as WebVoyager, hence the `--eval_oai_config` argument
- Set `--browserbase` for browser session management (requires exported API key and project ID environment variables)
- Avoid overloading a single VLLM deployment with more than ~10 concurrent processes due to known issues
- See debugging output in `fara/webeval/scripts/stdout.txt`

## Analyzing Evaluation Results

### Evaluation Output Structure

Evaluation results are stored under `--out_url` in folders organized by:
- Model name
- Dataset
- Username
- Run ID

Example path:
```
/runs/WebSurfer-fara-100-max_n_images-3/fara-7b/<username>/WebVoyager_WebVoyager_data_08312025.jsonl/<run_id>
```

Each evaluation folder contains:
- `gpt_eval/` - LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results
- `traj/` - Per-task trajectory subdirectories containing:
  - `final_answer.json` (e.g., `Amazon--1_final_answer.json`) - `<no_answer>` indicates abortion or step budget exceeded
  - `scores/gpt_eval.json` - LLM judge scores
  - `web_surfer.log` - Action history and errors
  - `screenshot_X.png` - Screenshots captured before each action X

### Running Analysis

Use the analysis notebook to compute metrics:

```bash
cd webeval/scripts/analyze_eval_results/
jupyter notebook analyze.ipynb
```

The script:
- Identifies trajectories aborted mid-execution and diagnostic reasons
- Computes average scores across non-aborted trajectories
- Distinguishes between aborted trajectories (errors during sampling) and completed trajectories (with terminate() call or step budget exceeded)

To re-run failed tasks, execute the evaluation script again with the same `run_id` and `username` - it will skip non-aborted tasks.

<details>
<summary>Example WebVoyager GPT Eval Result</summary>

```json
{
  "score": 1.0,
  "gpt_response_text": "To evaluate the task, we need to verify if the criteria have been met:\n\n1. **Recipe Requirement**: A vegetarian lasagna recipe with zucchini and at least a four-star rating.\n\n2. **Search and Results**:\n   - The screenshots show that the search term used was \"vegetarian lasagna zucchini.\"\n   - Among the search results, \"Debbie's Vegetable Lasagna\" is prominently featured.\n   \n3. **Evaluation of the Recipe**:\n   - Rating: \"Debbie's Vegetable Lasagna\" has a rating of 4.7, which satisfies the requirement of being at least four stars.\n   - The presence of zucchini in the recipe is implied through the search conducted, though the screenshots do not explicitly show the ingredients list. However, the result response confirms the match to the criteria.\n\nGiven the information provided, the task seems to have fulfilled the requirement of finding a vegetarian lasagna recipe with zucchini and a four-star rating or higher. \n\n**Verdict: SUCCESS**"
}
```
